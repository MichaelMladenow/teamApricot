We should add a piece of code to inform people how big ships are 
Because when you try to set a ship somewhere and it crosses the grid's boundaries
you get an Invalid Input Error (which is cool) but it's hard to keep in mind 
how the grid is formed, where your ships are and how they're positioned (vertical
or horizontal).
