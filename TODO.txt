BattleShips TODO list
-------------------------------------------------------------------

> Add a limitation to guesses + how many guesses left.
> Guesses should only account for clicking empty squares. 
> If guesses made > guessLimit = you lose.
> Game over screen should display a winning/losing message instead of only "Play again"
	> It should also contain the score, guesses made, guesses hit/lost.
> The game should feature a score board, hosted online and downloaded and 
read by the game on each start. 
> We should make a nav menu for the game which takes:
	> Play - takes you to the game.
	> Scoreboard - takes you to the score board. - scoreboard opens a new window. 
	> Exit - exits the game.
> Playing sounds on clicking/winning/losing
