BattleShips TODO list
-------------------------------------------------------------------
> Make the game take ships with size > 5
 
> (Svilen-Done )Add a limitation to guesses(limit to 20) + how many guesses left.
		(Georgi - changed) - upped limit to 25 - less difficult.
> (Svilen-Done)Guesses should only account for clicking empty squares.
 
> (Georgi-Done)If guesses made > guessLimit = you lose.

> (Georgi-Done)Game over screen should display a winning/losing message.
Added a winning and a losing case, when you win, if you press the "No" button
at "Play Again", you are asked to enter your name so the game can keep your
winning score. If you lose the "No" button quits.

>(Nick-WIP) Add guesses count to Game over screen when losing

> (Georgi - Done) Added a local scoreboard which reads from a .txt in /src,
also added a separate frame to display it.WARNING - DO NOT leave a line
line in scoreFile.txt if you clean it up, make sure you've deleted all
spaces and newlines. Otherwise it will break the reader. Sorry.

>(NEW) Add some smooth formatting to the scoreboard text reader 
that will take names and scores and keep them centered. Also 
limit name length so it will always fit the reader

> (Georgi - deprecated)Add menus- (NEW)just add an EXIT button to the scoreboard
frame.
 
> Playing sounds on clicking/winning/losing
 
> (Svilen-Done) Adding battleship icons on info
		(Georgi - fixed) Aligned icons and changed their path to /src
		also changed code to load them. Moved "Miss" square and text
		upwards by a bit for better looks. Feel free to change.
